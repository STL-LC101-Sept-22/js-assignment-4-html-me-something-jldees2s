                  <h2>Early Years</h2>
                  <div class="column">
                  <p style="textLeft">Ed Sheeran was born on February 17, 1991, in Halifax, West Yorkshire, in the United Kingdom. When he was young, he began playing guitar, showing early promise as a musical talent. When he was 11, Sheeran met singer-songwriter Damien Rice backstage at one of Rice’s shows, and the young musician found added inspiration. It wasn’t long before Sheeran was recording CDs and selling them, and he soon put together his first official EP, <i>The Orange Room</i>. With that accomplishment and his abiding ambition driving him, at only 14 years of age, he headed to London for the summer.</p>
